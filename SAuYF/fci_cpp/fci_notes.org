* Generating integrals from fci_cpp #4
Integrals input file from fci_cpp, such that half_spin.f90 can directly consume it.

Format ham_ov.dat-
number of basis
Ov matrix
Core Hamiltonian matrix
Nuclear Repulsion

Format 2_ele.dat-
number of reduced integral
i,j,k,l, ee(i,j,k,l)

PS- 2_ele.dat to be generated as chemist notion because half_spin.f90 expect the format in chemist notion
, which converts internally to physicist notion ( generate both the chemist and physicist later can be decided which one to use)
